# How to contribute to the OAC project

First off, thank you for taking the time to prepare a contribution to
the Open Autconf macros project!

![You're awesome!](https://www.open-mpi.org/images/youre-awesome.jpg)

Note that this project is fairly narrowly focused: per [the OAC README
file](https://github.com/open-mpi/oac#readme), this is a convenience
repository to share Autoconf macros between a specific set of
projects.  It is not intended to be a repository for Autoconf macros
that are generally applicable to a wide variety of projects -- you may
want to look to the [GNU Autoconf
Archive](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/) for something
like that.

That being said, this repository generally adheres to the same
principles outlined in the [Open MPI contributing
guidelines](https://docs.open-mpi.org/en/main/contributing.html).
